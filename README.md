## Overview
This repository contains code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis demonstrates the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for understanding data patterns, trends, and relationships.

## What was done
- Loaded the Titanic dataset from a public URL.
- Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
- Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features.
- Built a correlation matrix and pairplots to explore feature relationships.
- Identified basic patterns and trends in the dataset through visualizations.

## Files
- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: The Colab notebook containing the analysis steps.
- Screenshots (if any) and dataset source link.

## Dataset
[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## How to run
